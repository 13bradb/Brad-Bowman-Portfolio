# Playstation's <i>Dreams</i> platform gives users an inuitive way to design sculptures, custom sounds, logic based systems, and full games. With this platform, I have been able to experiment and learn some rudimentary game development, something I have become increasingly passionate about!

## I have included some demo videos below: 

American Football Game: 
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fdGrKRZiwc">Uniform Customization and Throwing</a>
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQBdQOvCwck">Wide Receiver Catching/Defensive Back Coverage</a>
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAXp9LXJTTM">In Depth Uniform Customization</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Zov06GVx0">Sci-Fi Item Interactions</a><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzYwCDx0E3U">Grabbable Items</a><br>
- Note: at the time of making this, Dreams did not have a system for grabbing items with both hands. So, I made my own!
