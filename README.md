I am a computer science student at Seattle Pacific University. I have a wide variety of interests in the realm of computer science, but my top three are: 
- Cybersecurity
- Game design
- Technology/software solutions in athletics

My interest in cybersecurity was spurred on by my grandfather's involvment in intelligence work for the military. I have always had an affinity for game design as I appreciate small, careful details that provides an enjoyable experience for a lot of people. I am currently on my university's track and field team and have been working on solutions for us to effectively record and review live footage during practice. These efforts have led me to be interested in practical, technology based solutions in the world of athletics.
